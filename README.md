### Background
Skimify AI is an education tool that is built on top of the ChatGPT API and was built with the goal of promoting first princinples learning by converting large texts into a simplified mind-map allowing the user to pick which ideas/concepts they would like to explore. 

The frontend of website was built using React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS. The backend of the website was built using Flask, PostgreSQL and Redis.
For deployment, we dockerized our backend and deployed using AWS Elastic beanstalk, and the frontend was stored in an S3 bucket. In addition, we created a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions to improve our developer workflow.
